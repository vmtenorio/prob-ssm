# Tracking Network Dynamics using Probabilistic State-Space Models

This repository contains the code for the paper "Tracking Network Dynamics using Probabilistic State-Space Models", by Victor M. Tenorio, Elvin Isufi, Geert Leus and Antonio G. Marques. The paper has been submitted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025).

The code is organized as follows:

- The notebook `SyntheticExperiment.ipynb` contains the experiment in Section V.A with synthetic data.
- The notebook `AirportDataExperiment.ipynb` contains the experiment in Section V.B with airport data retrieved from OAG database.
